Ilander Assignment
Unity version 2022.3.10f1

Student: Aaron Marklund
Name of Project: Space Cleaner

This project was supposed to be like battlefront 2 spaceship battles when it comes to controls.
The objective is to shoot the debris on the way to get to the other station.
I recommend playing with the controller because the controls for keyboard and mouse are kind of wonky.
The game can be played split screen where one player uses a keyboard and the other uses a controller.
There can only be two players at the same time.

I have put all the noteworthy scripts into one folder called NoteWorthy scripts.

When I write code I try to group together variables and methods that I use for a similar purpose. 
I try not to use lambda too much but I do like to keep the amount of code lines to a minimum.
When coding I have a fast Creativity faze where I test my ideas and a FIX faze where I go back and make the code more optimized and flexible.


How to play:

The starting scene is Main Menu
After pressing start with the mouse either press ENTER on keyboard to join with keyboard and mouse or START on the controller.
